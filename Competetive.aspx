<div class="div2" >Competetive</div>

<div class="CompetetiveDiv">Competitive is one of the two core <a href="Online.aspx">Online Gameplay modes.</a> 
The Competitive mode is based purely on skill tiers which will loosely determine the skill of a player. </div>

<div class="div2" >Playlists</div>
<div class="CompetetiveDiv">There are four Competitive playlists: <br />

1. Solo Duel <br />
2. Doubles <br />
3. Solo Standard <br />
4. Standard <br />

Each player has a separate progression for each playlist (i.e. it is possible to be a Challenger II in Doubles and a Rising Star in Standard). 
</div>

<div class="div2" >Solo Duel</div>
<div class="CompetetiveDiv">
Solo Duel is arguably the most balanced in terms of raw skill. Because it is simply a one-on-one game, Solo Duel is not based at all on cooperating 
in a team, but on strategy and skill in the arena.  
</div>

<div class="div2" >Doubles</div>
<div class="CompetetiveDiv">
Doubles is the most popular Competitive playlist. Doubles is very popular because Standard tends to balance the game less proportionally when there are more players to play with or against. In doubles, you need to cooperate with only one teammate.
</div>

<div class="div2" >Solo Standard</div>
<div class="CompetetiveDiv">
Solo Standard is perhaps the least popular Competitive playlist. The matchmaking will place you randomly with 2 players of your skill tier against 3 random other players also of your skill tier. This playlist forces you to cooperate with the largest number of teammates available in ranked along with the team variation. 
</div>

<div class="div2" >Standard</div>
<div class="CompetetiveDiv">
Standard is a relatively popular Competitive playlist. This playlist is similar to Solo Standard, except the matchmaking for this playlist is less strict, giving you leeway to choose your teammates. This way, the playlist is a lot more determinant on your and other players’ ability to choose teams or even to play against teams. Though Solo Standard creates a balanced environment, playing this playlist solo could be recommended, as playing Standard will usually choose 2 other players on your team based on the 3 opponent players, and not only the matchmaking average, leading to higher and lower skilled players being placed with you, giving you a chance to balance with them. 
</div>

<div class="div2" >Tiers</div>
<div class="CompetetiveDiv">
Introduced in Season 2, Competitive Tiers replace the preceding Ranking system and Ranked Points with a brand new set of skill tiers, skill rating and a much more complicated progression system. In addition, all players are required to play 10 placement matches in a single playlist, otherwise they remain locked in the Unranked tier.

If you are in the Unranked tier, the game will place you in a tier after 10 matches based on your performance. You can track the progression of your Competitive status on the tier display that shows up at the end of the game or from the main menu’s matchmaking window.

As the 10 games progress, matchmaking will put you in games with people of or closer to your current tier. It takes an average of 4 last games for the game to know your tier, but there are 6 more for assurance. Once you are finally placed in your final tier for the first time, you will be put in Division II of your skill tier.

Below is the current Competitive Tiers list:

Season 4 ranks: <br /> <br />
Unranked <br />
Bronze I <br />
Bronze II <br />
Bronze III <br />
Silver I <br />
Silver II <br />
Silver III <br />
Gold I <br />
Gold II <br />
Gold III <br />
Platinum I <br />
Platinum II <br />
Platinum III <br />
Diamond I <br />
Diamond II <br />
Diamond III <br />
Champion I <br />
Champion II <br />
Champion III <br />
Grand Champion <br /> <br />
Each tier has four divisions, ranging from Division I (the lowest) to Division IV (the highest). You can go up or down a division within a tier based on how many matches you’ve won.<br />

Note: The Champion tier group is reserved for a very small percentage of players. The game is constantly adjusting this percentage.
